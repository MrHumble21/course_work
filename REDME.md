# home page > appointment 
I have made a form in which patients can fill the form and choose a time doctor, type of service they want to receive, and the department.



# home page > appointment > authentication of the user (preventing robots to fill the form)

I have created a little authentication box. that box gives an arithmetical question to the user to prevent attacking or something wrong happening.
for achieving this a have used JavaScript. 
if the user enters the wrong answer it will not show the sign-up button. 
as soon as a user enters a correct answer to the form, the sign-up button will appear and an authentication form will be disappeared.

I have taken google API to demonstrate an address of the clinics.
